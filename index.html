    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I am a self-taught web developer who's trying to stand out. I graduated from Cascade High School in June of 2023. While attending Cascade, I enrolled in the Running Start program which saw me enrolling at Everett Community College full-time. I will also be aquiring an Associate's Degree in Computer Science in the near future. Since graduated I have found myself enrolled and follwing The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy. I plan on attending Coding Dojo's Software Engineering bootcamp in August of 2023. I have found a love in programming and enjoy to expand my horizons.</p>
